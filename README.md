# Git-Github-for-Developers
This is intro to git and github and how to use it without all the hassle

## What is git?
In programming world most of the time you are not working alone,so [git](https://git-scm.com/) is a piece of software which allows you to collaborate with others.According to git official site git is *distributed version control system*, there are many version control system out there but git is the most popular once.*Version Control* itself means keeping track of changes to your software during its lifecycle, think it like checkpoints in games when you complete a mission a checkpoint is saved which tells the next time you play that game you have to start from there, git is also like that it makes these checkpoints and you can go back to them any time you need.Infact the creator of linux kernel Linus Torvalds, is the creator of git.You can use git using command line or their gui.You can [install](https://git-scm.com/downloads) git from here.

## What is github?
Github is *Built for Developers*. It uses git internally but it adds a lot of extra features on top it like commits,forks,issues etc. Think of github as a way of managing your code with git but it's on the cloud. Github has many learning resources, I will list the popular once:
1. [Learn git by playing](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) This is very interesting resource, you don't need to setup anything all the commands are inbuilt in this and it has levels like games, which you have to complete.
2. [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/) This is the official guide from the github teams, it is very nicely written to understand every bits and pieces.
3. [Try Github](http://try.github.io/) It lists all the resources to learn git, if you are a complete beginner go with this one.
